The objective of our work is to achieve a deeper understanding of the molecular details of membrane disruption by the amyloid β (Aβ) peptide, which constitutes one of the major mechanisms of Aβ neurotoxicity during Alzheimer's disease (AD). Such a study is topical and essential in light of recent FDA approval of three Aβ-targeting antibodies for treatment of AD and the ever-rising public concern regarding AD dementia. The upmost value of our study is that it presents the first atomic resolution structure of Aβ1-42 reconstituted in lipid bilayer membranes. High resolution structures of this peptide in aqueous medium or in detergent micelles have been reported before, but its structure when embedded in a lipid membrane has remained elusive. We have combined Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, solid state NMR (ssNMR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and molecular dynamics (MD) approaches to identify a unique oligomeric structure of Aβ1-42 stabilized by membrane lipids and cholesterol. TEM images of lipid vesicles with AE show membrane-inserted Aβ oligomers and membrane fragmentation by the peptide. Aβ1-42 forms an octameric, in register cross-β sheet structure with the backbone chain running parallel to the membrane plane and curling to form an internal lipid-filled cavity. This novel fold of the Aβ1-42 peptide is supported by ssNMR-derived residue-specific chemical shifts that are in good agreement with MD simulations. In addition, the mode of insertion of the peptide into the lipid bilayer was characterized by heteronuclear correlation experiments, completing the supramolecular structure of the peptide-lipid complex.
